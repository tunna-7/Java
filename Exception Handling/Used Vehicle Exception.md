## Q
### Create a UsedVehicleException class that extends Exception; its constructor receives a value for a vehicle identification number (VIN) that is passed to the parent constructor so it can be used in a getMessage() call. Create a UsedVehicle class with fields for VIN, make, year, mileage, and price. The UsedVehicle constructor throws a UsedVehicleException when the VIN is not four digits; when the make is not Ford, Honda, Toyota, or Other; when the year is not between 2000 and 2020 inclusive; or either the mileage or price is negative. Write a Java application that establishes an array of at least five UsedVehicle objects and handles any Exceptions. Display a list of only the UsedVehicle objects that were constructed successfully.
